Montecarluni - a Montecarlo tool for JIRA

Currently this tool does one thing:

Given a JIRA CSV file containing only resolved tickets, on import, generates the distribution of resolved tickets on a weekly basis.

This tool does not yet perform Montecarlo simulations itself, but the data can be pasted into Troy Magennis's "Throughput Forecaster",
available in his spreadsheets at his <a href="http://bit.ly/SimResources">Focused Objective Github.</a>
